# nt_christmas_decorations

## A Christmas Decorations plugin for Neotokyo.

Made by Rain (plugin code) and John Kaz (the present box model).

Last update: 2020-12-23

This SourceMod plugin spawns seasonal gift boxes, and also adds a sm_gift/sm_present command for spawning some more.

### Installation

* Compile the source code in "addons". It requires SourceMod 1.7 or newer, and the Neotokyo SM include:
    * https://github.com/softashell/sourcemod-nt-include

* Add all of the "materials" and "models" file paths to your server. If you're using fastdl, be sure to include the files in those folders there, as well.
    * They can be .bz2'd on fastdl, but only as individual files (no folder structure inside the archive).

### License
* Please see the [repo main page's readme document](https://github.com/Rainyan/nt-festive-decorations) for details.
